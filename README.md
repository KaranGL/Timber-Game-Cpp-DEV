# Timber-Game

Used OpenGL/SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), enumerations, loops, arrays, switch, SFML Time, textures, sprites to cut as many logs off an infinite length tree with a limited time period.

This is an individual project. Not an original idea (learned this from the C++ game programming course on Linkedin Learning)
