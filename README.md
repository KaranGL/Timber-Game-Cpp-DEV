# Timber-Game

This project is made using OpenGL/SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to cut as many logs off an infinite length tree with a limited time period.

This is an individual project. Not an original idea (learned this from the C++ game programming course on Linkedin Learning)

Instructions to play: 

  1.) Tree Cutting â€“ Left and Right Key
  
  2.) Exit - Esc
